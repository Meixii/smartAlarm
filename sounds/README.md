# Alarm Sound Files

This directory contains the sound files used by the Smart Alarm system. The following files are required for basic operation:

## Required Files

1. `gentle_wake.mp3` - Default gentle wake-up sound (soft, gradually increasing volume)
2. `standard_alarm.mp3` - Standard alarm sound
3. `urgent_alarm.mp3` - Louder, more attention-grabbing alarm sound

## Recommended Sound File Specifications

- Format: MP3
- Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz
- Bit Rate: 192 kbps or higher
- Duration: 30-60 seconds (will be looped during playback)
- Volume: Normalized to prevent sudden volume changes

## Sound File Guidelines

1. Gentle Wake Sound:
   - Should start soft and gradually increase in intensity
   - Use calming, natural sounds (birds, flowing water, soft music)
   - Avoid sudden changes in volume or harsh frequencies

2. Standard Alarm:
   - Medium intensity
   - Clear, distinct sound pattern
   - Easy to recognize but not jarring

3. Urgent Alarm:
   - Higher intensity
   - More attention-grabbing
   - Suitable for heavy sleepers

## Adding Custom Sounds

You can add your own custom alarm sounds to this directory. Make sure to:
1. Use MP3 format
2. Name the files descriptively
3. Update the alarm settings in the web interface to use your custom sounds

## Default Sound Attribution

Please replace these placeholder files with actual sound files before using the system. You can obtain suitable alarm sounds from:
- Royalty-free music libraries
- Sound effect websites
- Your own recordings

Note: Ensure you have the proper rights/licenses to use any sound files you add to this system.
